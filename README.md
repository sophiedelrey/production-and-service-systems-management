projects for the course "Production and Service Systems Management" at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NTUA. The course covers key concepts in operations management, production planning, supply chain optimization, and service system analysis.
# Task 01 - Production Planning Optimization Using Linear Programming (LP)
This assignment focuses on optimizing a manufacturing company's production plan using linear programming to minimize total costs. Given monthly demand estimates, the company must balance production costs (€50/unit), inventory holding (€0.8/unit/month), production rate changes (increase: €1.3/unit, decrease: €2/unit), overtime (€2.5/unit), and underutilization (€4/unit) while adhering to a maximum production capacity of 1,800 units per month. The objective is to formulate and solve an LP model using a computational tool  [Excel](https://excel.cloud.microsoft/) to determine the optimal production schedule.
# Task 02 - Materials Requirement Planning (MRP)
This assignment involves Materials Requirement Planning (MRP) for a furniture manufacturing company producing bed X. The product structure includes side rails (part B), base layers (part A), and components (C & D) with given lead times, initial stock, and lot sizes. Using the Bill of Materials (BOM) and gross requirements schedule, students must determine the production schedule for each component following the MRP methodology. The goal is to calculate the necessary material orders and optimize production planning. The problem solved by using a computational tool  [Excel](https://excel.cloud.microsoft/)
